**Comparative Assessment of High-Resolution Satellite-Based Building Footprint Extraction Methods**


**Overview**
In this project, we intend to compare different machine learning algorithms for image classification to develop a general framework for fire-induced building damage evaluation from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery in California.Our results show promising utility for machine learning models, based on spectral, texture, and convolutional features, in the applications for post-fire building-damage monitoring. For the binary classification scheme, the Random Forest (RF) classifier performed the best (Table II) with an overall accuracy of 93% and a Cohenâ€™s kappa of 0.73. For the multiclass scheme (i.e without vegetation mask), XGBoost performed better than the 5-layer neural networks. It is able to detect building areas but is less accurate in predicting damage when compared with the binary case. Feature engineering also proved to be an essential step in model building. Particularly, the addition of SNIC segmentation which greatly aided in the improvement of overall model performance for both RF and XGBoost classifiers.
